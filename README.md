## Abstract Classes

- Can't be used to create an object directly
- Only used as a parent class
- Can contain real implementation for some methods
- The implemented methods can refer to other methods that don't actually exist yet (we still have to provide names and types for the un-implemented methods)
- Can make child classes promise to implement some other method
